# CANtieCAR_modeswitch

A handy little program for switching modes on the CANtieCAR interface.  
Shortcuts can be created to switch modes with a single click.

Usage: CANtieCAR_modeswitch.exe \[3-digit ID\]  
E.g. "CANtieCAR_modeswitch.exe 000" for Loopback.  
IDs can be found by plugging in your CANtieCAR and pressing "4".

NOTE: Please don't store this program on the CANtieCAR interface!  
Some modes doesn't expose the thumbdrive, so you won't be able to use shortcuts.

Requires [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
